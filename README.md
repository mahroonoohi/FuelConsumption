# FuelConsumption
This repository contains a **machine learning project** that predicts **COâ‚‚ emissions** based on **fuel consumption** and other vehicle characteristics.   The goal is to analyze real-world data and build models that can estimate carbon emissions using supervised learning algorithms.



## ðŸ“˜ Overview
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (`FuelConsumption.ipynb`)  
- **Category:** Machine Learning / Data Science

---

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow
The notebook follows these main steps:
1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Inspecting and visualizing fuel consumption and emission data.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing data.  
3. **Model Training** â€“ Implementing and comparing models such as:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Polynomial Features  
4. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Assessing model performance using RÂ², MAE, and MSE metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset typically contains:
- Vehicle make and model  
- Engine size  
- Fuel type  
- Fuel consumption (city, highway, combined)  
- COâ‚‚ emissions (target variable)
